# resticAutoForget
Restic windows .bat file. Solve the problem of adding too many same snapshots.Create a new snapshot only if the source folder changes.

Most of the time I don‚Äôt make changes to the file, so there will be a lot of new snapshots that are the same as the previous one. Restic don't has ‚Äúflag‚Äù to 
achieve,This bat file will work, which is too concise.

It seems hard to find a filesystem watcher in windows system.

- [x] I have written RESTIC_PASSWORD in the environment variable before ‚úîüòÉ

```batch
@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
set resitcpath="C:\autobackup"
rem your repo path
set /a allrow=0
set /a row=1
set /a diffrow=0

for /f "delims=" %%i in ('restic -r %resitcpath% snapshots') do (
set /a allrow+=1
)
rem sum how many rows output

set /a lastrow=%allrow%-2
set /a prerow=%allrow%-3
for /f "delims=" %%i in ('restic -r %resitcpath% snapshots') do (
if !row!==%prerow% set prerowid=%%i
if !row!==%lastrow% set lastrowid=%%i
set /a row+=1
)
set idpre=%prerowid:~0,8%
set idlast=%lastrowid:~0,8%
rem find lastest two snapshots and get IDs

for /f "delims=" %%j in ('restic -r %resitcpath% diff %idpre% %idlast%') do (
set /a diffrow+=1
echo %%j
)
rem sum how many rows restic diff output

echo %diffrow%
if %diffrow%==8 (
restic -r %resitcpath% forget %idlast%
)
rem if restic diff output rows is 8 than shows nothing changed.Use resitc forget to delete the newest snapshot.
```
